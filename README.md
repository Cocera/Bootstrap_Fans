## About the project
This is a project that aims to get an approach to Bootstrap through a research process in order to understand the tool and all that it can offer us. We will apply the knowledge acquired by integrating Bootstrap components to a personal website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website, in addition to putting into practice the components of the tool, we apply the storage in localStorage, forms and validations through JS.
